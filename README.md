# ATM-vending-Machine
This project involves the development of an ATM simulation system using Java, implementing object-oriented programming concepts. The system features a user-friendly interface allowing predefined users to perform basic banking operations like balance inquiry, cash deposits, and cash withdrawals. The project includes the following components:

User Class: Represents a bank user with attributes like name, unique code, and balance. It also contains methods to deposit and withdraw cash while validating transactions.
ATM Class: Manages user authentication and provides a menu-driven interface for interaction. It includes predefined users and handles the main functionalities such as displaying balance, depositing, and withdrawing cash.
Main Class: Serves as the entry point for the program, facilitating user authentication and accessing the ATM menu.
This project demonstrates proficiency in Java, understanding of data structures like HashMap for storing user information, and the implementation of interactive console-based applications.
